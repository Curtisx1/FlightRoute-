Flight Route Planning using Weighted Directed Graph


**Directions:**

Mini Project: Flight Route Planning using Weighted Directed Graph
Objective: To plan flight routes between airports using a weighted directed graph.
Description:
1.	Create a dataset with a list of airports and the distances or costs of flights between them.
2.	Construct a weighted directed graph where nodes represent airports, and directed edges represent flights, with edge weights representing distances or costs.
3.	Allow for cases where there may be one-way flights.
4.	Tasks:
a. Find the shortest path between two specified airports using an appropriate shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).
b. Identify airports that are hubs, i.e., airports with the most incoming or outgoing flights.
c. Determine if there are any unreachable airports from a specified starting airport.
Deliverables:
1.	Source code of the application.
2.	Documentation explaining the graph representation, algorithms used, and how to use the application.
Evaluation Criteria:
•	Correct implementation of graph representation and shortest path algorithm.
•	Accurate identification of hub airports and unreachable airports.
•	Proper handling of one-way flights.
•	Clear and concise documentation.
Note: This project challenges students to apply graph theory concepts in the context of flight route planning, which is a practical scenario. It introduces them to the concept of a weighted directed graph and its application in transportation planning.
